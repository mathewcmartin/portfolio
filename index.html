<!--
  [x]  As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.

  [x]  As the creator, I want the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me, and I can build my audience.

  [x]  As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.

  [x]  As a developer, I want my CSS organized (think SMACSS) so that I can find my stylings swiftly.

User Stories: Stretch Goals

  []  As a visitor, I want the portfolio to show the newest material on top so that I can easily see the developers recent work.

  []  As a visitor, I want relative timestamps on such material to give me a idea of how many days ago something was created.

Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

  []  Think of some ideas for your source data, and code it up in its own file! Build out an array of three objects to start with, all having similar properties.

  []  Create a new .js file with the appropriate methods to help modify your source data to help render it to the DOM:
  Use good Object Oriented code: Create a constructor function for projects or source data.

  []  Leave as little in the window (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.

  []  Use jQuery to clone the example markup for each project, as you add additional content.

  []  Your "Project" prototype should have a .toHtml() function that adds new data to the DOM.
  Refactor your CSS into a base, layout, and module structure where applicable.
