##User Stories: Stretch Goals


  []  As a visitor, I want the portfolio to show the newest material on top so that I can easily see the developers recent work.

  []  As a visitor, I want relative timestamps on such material to give me a idea of how many days ago something was created.

##Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

  [x]  Think of some ideas for your source data, and code it up in its own file! Build out an array of three objects to start with, all having similar properties.

  [x]  Create a new .js file with the appropriate methods to help modify your source data to help render it to the DOM:

  [x]  Use good Object Oriented code: Create a constructor function for projects or source data.

  [x]  Leave as little in the window (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.

  [x]  Use jQuery to clone the example markup for each project, as you add additional content.

  [x]  Your "Project" prototype should have a .toHtml() function that adds new data to the DOM.
  Refactor your CSS into a base, layout, and module structure where applicable.

##Portfolio assignment for class 3

**Continue building and improving your portfolio site. Here's how you can leverage events:**

Adapt these stories as necessary to fit how you want to build your portfolio.
User Stories: MVP

  []  As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act   as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST. This means your links to NOT navigate to a new page. Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected. You can use 'data-' attributes to associate a content section with a particular tab. Then use jQuery so when the tab is clicked, you hide all the sections, then reveal the associated section only.

  [] As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.

##Stretch Goals (not required):

  []  As a reader, I want project descriptions truncated to the first paragraph so that I can easily scroll though the whole list.

  []  As a reader, I want to click the "More" button so that I can expand the entire description.

  []  As a reader, I want projects filterable by category so that I can review just the things that interest me.

##Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

  []  Use event delegation whenever appropriate.

  []  Add click handlers to at least one nav section.

  []  Do as much work as you can with advanced selectors, rather than littering your markup with classes and ids.

  [] When classes and IDs are needed, pick semantic names. There is to be no $('#content .content') nonsense!

##Use what you learned in the class 4 lecture to improve the structure of your Portfolio app codebase.

##User Stories: MVP

  []  As a developer, I want to use Handlebars for my project template, so that I can include new projects more easily.

  []  As a developer, I want my CSS styles to follow SMACSS organization, so that I know where to look for creating and editing styles.

##User Stories: Stretch Goal

  []  As a visitor, I want the site to use great typography, so that I have an enjoyable reading experience.

  []  Set up your h1, h2, h3 elements according to a type scale(another good type scale article).
    Include some good fonts, that work well together.

##Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

  []  Add Handlebars to your blogging system.

**Organize your CSS code according to SMACSS, with at least a file for base, layout, and modules.**
